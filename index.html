                  Statement of Purpose
                </h5>
                To teach my students how to sing in the most free, expressive, and enjoyable manner.

                <h5 class="mt-4">
                  The Lesson
                </h5>
                I typically offer my students one private, one-hour lesson per week.  In order to take full advantage of our time, I recommend that the student records each lesson.  Also, it is a good idea to collect every few recordings in order to gauge one’s progress.  Students are always welcome to e-mail or call with questions during the week.  The first half-hour is usually focused on vocal exercises and technique, while the second half is devoted to the singer’s repertoire.  The more experienced students are invited to sing in semi-annual recitals in Berkeley.

                <h5 class="mt-4">
                  The Method
                </h5>
                The technique I teach to all students is rooted in bel canto, which is most commonly exhibited by classical singers.  Other influences include Alexander technique, Feldenkrais method, and my twenty years of private teaching experience.  This method serves as a strong and flexible foundation upon which most genres of singing benefit.  My students sing Classical, Musical Theatre, Pop, Jazz, and Non-Western literature.

                <h5 class="mt-4">
                  Age & Experience
                </h5>
                I do not have a minimum age requirement for entry into my studio.  However, due to the physical sound demands, I usually suggest that young singers do not start until their voice changes (in their mid-teens).  I accept students of all levels and abilities to my studio.  Whether a student has plans for a career in voice or a hobbyist, my only demand is that the student maintains consistent practice.
